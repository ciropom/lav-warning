1. android sdk in $ANDROID_SDK
2. titanium mobile sdk in $TITANIUM_SDK
3. some avd (at least one, created using $ANDROID_SDK/tools/android 
app)

TO RUN:
go to LAV_Warning folder
run an avd:
$ANDROID_SDK/tools/emulator-arm -avd <youravd>

when the avd is ready type

titanium.py run

Note: titanium.py is in the mobilesdk folder of titanium sdk

this will compile LAV Warning and install its debug version in the emulator.


To build the release version 

be sure to have a debug version compiled with the

titanium.py run

command in the LAV_Warning/build/android/bin folder. 
The default app name should be "app.apk".
 
Go to LAV_Warning and type 

./release.sh

this script takes the "app.apk" debug version, 
strips out from it some unneeded libraries and sign it using a keystore created with keytool 
(see jdk documentation for further informations)
that is assumed to be in the root folder and named "apk.keystore".
The key named "mykey" in the keystore would be used.

this will create in LAV_Warning/dist/
two apk, 
LAV_Warning.apk which is signed with the apk.keystore key
LAV_Warning-unsigned.apk wich is unsigned.
